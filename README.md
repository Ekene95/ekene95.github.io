This repository hosts my professional portfolio, architected to demonstrate the intersection of **Offensive Security research** and **Defensive DevSecOps engineering**.

---

## rchitectural Overview
The portfolio is designed as a stateless, high-performance web presence using a SaaS-inspired theme. It leverages **Mermaid.js** for real-time architectural rendering.

### Core Tech Stack:
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Custom Variables), Inter/JetBrains Mono Typography.
* **Logic Visualization:** Mermaid.js (Architecture-as-Code).
* **Deployment:** GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions.

## Featured Case Study: Project NetShield
The primary technical highlight of this portfolio is **Project NetShield**, a supply chain security framework I developed to solve the "Security Debt" of unverified base images.

**Key Engineering Wins:**
* **Shift-Left Order:** Build → Scan → Push → Sign.
* **Parallel Validation:** Independent AMD64 and ARM64 scanning using a GitHub Matrix strategy.
* **Provenance:** Keyless OIDC signing with **Sigstore/Cosign**.
