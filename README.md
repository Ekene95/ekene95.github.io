## 🏗️ Project Architecture

This portfolio is designed as a lightweight, high-performance **Single Page Application (SPA)**. It avoids heavy frameworks in favor of semantic HTML5 and vanilla CSS to ensure maximum speed and accessibility.

### Technical Implementation
* **Core Structure:** Semantic HTML5 for SEO and accessibility.
* **Styling:** Custom CSS3 using CSS Variables (`:root`) for a consistent "SaaS/Architect" dark theme (Navy/Teal).
* **Diagrams as Code:** Integrated **Mermaid.js** to render architectural flowcharts dynamically within the browser.
* **Visual Assets:** FontAwesome 6 for iconography; Custom high-fidelity architecture diagrams for case studies.

## 🛡️ Featured Case Studies

The portfolio highlights two major architectural standards I have designed and implemented:

### 1. The Enterprise "Golden Pipeline"
A standardized DevSecOps workflow enforcing supply chain governance.
* **Tech:** GitHub Actions, Snyk, TruffleHog, Cosign.
* **Key Mechanism:** Mandatory artifact verification via Google Artifact Registry before deployment to AWS ECS.

### 2. Zero-Touch Identity Lifecycle
An automated Identity & Access Management (IAM) framework.
* **Tech:** Okta Workflows, Jira Service Management, JumpCloud, Python.
* **Key Mechanism:** HR-triggered provisioning and instant "kill-switch" deprovisioning to enforce Zero Trust.
