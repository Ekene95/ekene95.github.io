    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Application Security Engineer with half a decade of diverse experience in IT and cybersecurity, specializing in application security across the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). Skilled in securing mobile, web, and API applications, as well as software supply chains. I possess a deep understanding of threat modeling, code reviews, penetration testing, and supply chain security assessments, which I apply across each stage of development to protect against potential vulnerabilities and threats. Proficient in designing and managing secure CI/CD pipelines that incorporate private artifact registries, container scanning, code quality checks, and static and dynamic application security testing (SAST/DAST), to secure the software supply chain, reducing risks by enforcing strict security measures and maintaining software integrity. In previous roles within the information technology industry, I've provided essential vulnerability assessments, cloud security, and technical support for critical systems. Let’s connect to strengthen your organization’s security posture with comprehensive application and infrastructure security solutions.</p>
